## Features

## Getting started:

- Starting the app with docker-compose

```bash
$ clone the repo
$ cd into the repo
$ docker-compose up
```

Then you can open the React frontend at localhost:3000 and the Node API at localhost:5000

Changing any frontend (React) code locally will cause a hot-reload in the browser with updates and changing any backend (Node) code locally will also automatilly update any changes.

- Starting the app without docker-compose

```bash
$ clone the repo
$ cd into the repo
$ cd client && yarn start && cd .. && cd server && npm run dev
```

Then you can open the React frontend at localhost:3000 and the Node API at localhost:5000
